Imports artists and/or albums to a Lidarr install from a CSV obtained at Exportify. Will prompt user for URL, API, and the CSV file. Attaching a demo CSV here as well. Available as ready-to-go EXE or python. Note: the easiest way to use the exe is to click and drag the API key from Lidarr as well as click and drag your CSV. No built-in error handling, so make sure you don't make typos in URL (or forget https:// or http:// or port).
